# Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM
In this project we provide a full and whole framework for using Drones in general, and the DJI Tello specifficaly.

In this project you will find a GUI that will allow you to control the Tello and command it to move in the x,y,z,pitch,roll,yaw plane.

Using this GUI will allow fast development of SLAM algorithms and integrate them with real Tello hardware.

The coordinates are derived from a pose that is published in one of the 2 slam algorithms (orbslam2 or ccmslam)

Inside the files, you will find a joystick/keyboard to control the tello from within ROS, instead of using your android phone.

# Install Guide
## Installing ROS melodic

Following this page: http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu

### Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org. :

```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
```

### Set up your keys
```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
```

### Installation
First, make sure your Debian package index is up-to-date:
```
sudo apt update
```

### Desktop-Full Install: (Recommended) : ROS, rqt, rviz, robot-generic libraries, 2D/3D simulators and 2D/3D perception
```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full
```

### Initialize rosdep
Before you can use ROS, you will need to initialize rosdep. rosdep enables you to easily install system dependencies for source you want to compile and is required to run some core components in ROS.
```
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

### Environment setup
It's convenient if the ROS environment variables are automatically added to your bash session every time a new shell is launched:
```
echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Dependencies for building packages
Up to now you have installed what you need to run the core ROS packages. To create and manage your own ROS workspaces, there are various tools and requirements that are distributed separately. For example, rosinstall is a frequently used command-line tool that enables you to easily download many source trees for ROS packages with one command.
To install this tool and other dependencies for building ROS packages, run:
``` 
sudo apt install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
```

# Install Prerequisites
## Easy Install Prerequisites
### catking tools
First you must have the ROS repositories which contain the .deb for catkin_tools:
```
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu `lsb_release -sc` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```
Once you have added that repository, run these commands to install catkin_tools:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools
```
### Eigen3
Required by g2o. Download and install instructions can be found here. Otherwise Eigen can be installed as a binary with:
```
sudo apt install libeigen3-dev
```
### ffmpeg
```
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
### Python catkin tools (probably already installed)
```
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools
```
### Joystick drivers
Tested it only on melodic.
```
sudo apt install ros-melodic-joystick-drivers
```
### Python PIL
```
sudo apt-get install python-imaging-tk
```
## Github based Prerequisites
### Pangolin (used in orbslam2)
Based on https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin
```
cd ~/ROS/
git clone https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.git
sudo apt install libgl1-mesa-dev
sudo apt install libglew-dev
sudo apt-get install libxkbcommon-dev
cd Pangolin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build
```

### h264decoder
Baed on https://github.com/DaWelter/h264decoder
```
cd ~/ROS/
git clone https://github.com/DaWelter/h264decoder.git
```
Inside h264decoder.cpp replace PIX_FMT_RGB24 with AV_PIX_FMT_RGB24
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
now copy it to python path
```
sudo cp ~/ROS/h264decoder/libh264decoder.so /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

# Installing Our Repository
## Cloning Our repo from github
```
cd ~
mkdir ROS
cd ROS
git clone https://github.com/tau-adl/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM.git
```
## Installing our version of TelloPy
based on https://github.com/dji-sdk/Tello-Python and https://github.com/hanyazou/TelloPy
```
cd ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/TelloPy
sudo python setup.py install
```
## Installing dependencies for ROS
```
cd ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/ROS/tello_catkin_ws/
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```

# Installing orbslam2
based on https://github.com/appliedAI-Initiative/orb_slam_2_ros
First - if using Melodic version of ROS, change the ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/ROS/tello_catkin_ws/src/orb_slam_2_ros/CMakeLists.txt
To the CMakeLists_melodic.txt
## Build the code:
```
cd ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/ROS/tello_catkin_ws/
catkin init
catkin clean
catkin build
```
If it doesnâ€™t work, make sure you changed the makefile to the wanted version of ROS
## Add the enviroment setup to bashrc
```
echo "source $PWD/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
# Installing ccm_slam
based on https://github.com/VIS4ROB-lab/ccm_slam
## Compile DBoW2:
```
cd ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/ROS/ccmslam_ws/src/ccm_slam/cslam/thirdparty/DBoW2/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```
## Compile g2o:
```
cd ~/ROS/Tello_ROS_ORBSLAM/ROS/ccmslam_ws/src/ccm_slam/cslam/thirdparty/g2o
mkdir build
